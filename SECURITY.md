# 🛡 Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, please email **security@agentcommunity.org** with:
- **Description** of the vulnerability  
- **Steps to reproduce** or proof-of-concept  
- **Impact assessment** and suggested mitigation

This information helps us prioritize and address the issue effectively.

## 📝 Coordinated Disclosure

Once a fix is ready, we will work with you privately to:
- Merge and deploy the patch  
- Assess user impact  
- Plan public disclosure so users have time to upgrade

If you'd like us to delay disclosure for sensitivity reasons, just let us know.
